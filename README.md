# Medirem Android application
This source code is being worked on to make a medicine reminder app for android in Metropolia UAS.
See "app/src/main/java/com/example/medirem_project/" for all the different codes and classes used for the app.

Plan is to make the application be able to save medicine written by the user and set alarms when to take certain medicine with descriptions.
