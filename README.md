# Medirem Android application
This source code is the result of a medicine reminder app for android in Metropolia UAS.
See "app/src/main/java/com/example/medirem_project/" for all the different codes and classes used for the app.

Plan was to make the application be able to save medicine written by the user and set alarms when to take certain medicine with descriptions.

The app is working with the ability to add custom medicine with names, descriptions, dates and times when to take them. The notifies the user at the correct time and you can tell the app that you have taken the medicine.
